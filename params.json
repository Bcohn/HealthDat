Lecture**\r\n\r\nEach class will begin with a brief (10-30 minute) presentation that motivates the material to be covered in class each day. See [placeholder](placeholder) for slides.\r\n\r\n**2. Discussion**\r\n\r\nAfter the lecture, we will discuss the assigned readings for that week. 3 students will serve as \"discussion leaders\" (see **Grading and Assignments** for more details on what being a discussion leader entails) for that week's readings. The discussion will last from 20 minutes up to an hour depending on the readings. \r\n\r\nIt is possible to choose the week that you will lead the discussion at the following link: [Discussion Leader Sign Up](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1svzQJrTfDFFFH--xqhFOL58WwkBAagmPBK0KOLVsIBo/edit?usp=sharing).\r\n\r\n**3. Workshops!**\r\n\r\nThe last hour to 90 minutes of each class will be devoted to a workshop. In the workshop students will work in groups to apply data analysis, visualization, and storytelling skills to the topic of the week. See [workshops](bco.hn/Workshops) for a list of workshops. \r\n\r\n###Syllabus\r\n\r\nThe course most recent version of the course [**Syllabus**](http://bco.hn/Syllabus.html) is available [**here**](http://bco.hn/Syllabus.html).\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n## Requirements\r\n\r\nThis course has absolutely **0** pre-requisites, and only one requirement -- that students have a laptop that they can bring to class each week. We will be using these laptops to binge watch Game of Thrones. Just kidding. \r\n\r\nWe'll be using the laptops to  complete the workshops. \r\n\r\nBecause students in this course have a wide range of experience, workshops are only _jumping off points for your personal investigations_. I will teach the necessary skills to complete each workshop, but if you already are familiar with the techniques to be covered, feel free to begin without me. \r\n\r\nFor this course we will be using the [R Project for Statistical Computing](http://www.r-project.org/) for our workshops. No programming experience is necessary, and a gentle introduction to R will be covered in the course see [R Resources](test) for more info on getting R set up on your laptop and learning the basics.  \r\n\r\n***\r\n##Grading and Assignments \r\n\r\nThe course grade components are :\r\n\r\n* 10% Infographic\r\n\r\n* 20% Journalism Piece\r\n\r\n* 40% Final Project\r\n\r\n* 15% Discussion Leadership & Participation\r\n\r\n* 15% Workshop Participation\r\n\r\n### Grading Details\r\n\r\n**1. Infographic**\r\n\r\nThe infographic is a basic visual representation of an interesting relationship found in health data. It will be assigned at the end of the second lecture **9/15/14** and is due two weeks later **9/29/14**. The infographic will be a simple one page document highlighting health disparities in the United States. It will serve as an introduction to both analysis and data visualization. You will use data from the Dartmouth Health Atlas (or a similar source, such as County Health Rankings) to construct their infographic. \r\n\r\n**2. Data driven journalism piece.**\r\n\r\nThe  journalism piece will use public access Medicare cost data and will consist of you guys writing an article similar in style to Elizabeth Rosenthalâ€™s great series of New York Times articles [a good example](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/06/health/even-small-medical-advances-can-mean-big-jumps-in-bills.html) and [all of her work](http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/r/elisabeth_rosenthal/index.html). It is to be no more than 2 pages in length, and feature no more than two 2 visualizations. This will be assigned in the fifth week of the course **10/6/14** and is due two weeks later **10/20/14**\r\n\r\n**3. Final Project**\r\n\r\nThe final project will consist of a policy analysis or data driven journalism piece. It will be at least 8 pages in length and include at least 3 visualizations. You must provide a rough draft a week before their presentation and give a 20-30 minute presentation of their work. The final projects will be assigned in the 8th week of the course **10/27/14** and be due whenever the final exam date for the course is. The last two classes will consist of students presenting their projects.\r\n\r\n**4. Discussion Leadership and Participation**\r\n\r\nYou are required to sign up to lead at least 3 discussions each. Leading a discussion entails reading and motivating the discussion for that weeks assigned papers.
