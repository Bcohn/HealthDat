<p><strong>Class Structure</strong>
Each class will have three parts:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Lecture
Each class will begin with a brief (10-30 minute) presentation that motivates the material to be covered in class each day. See <a href="placeholder">placeholder</a> for slides.</p></li>
<li><p>Discussion
After the lecture, we will discuss the assigned readings for that week. 3 students will serve as "discussion leaders" (see <strong>Grading and Assignments</strong> for more details on what being a discussion leader entails) for that week's readings. The discussion will last from 20 minutes up to an hour depending on the readings. </p></li>
</ol><p>It is possible to choose the week that you will lead the discussion at the following link: <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1svzQJrTfDFFFH--xqhFOL58WwkBAagmPBK0KOLVsIBo/edit?usp=sharing">Discussion Leader Sign Up</a>.</p>

<ol>
<li>Workshops! 
The last hour to 90 minutes of each class will be devoted to a workshop. In the workshop students will work in groups to apply data analysis, visualization, and storytelling skills to the topic of the week. See <a href="workshops">workshops</a> for a list of workshops. </li>

<hr><h2>
<a name="requirements" class="anchor" href="#requirements"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Requirements</h2>

<p>This course has absolutely <strong>0</strong> pre-requisites, and only one requirement -- that students have a laptop that they can bring to class each week. We will be using these laptops to binge watch Game of Thrones. Just kidding. </p>

<p>We'll be using the laptops to  complete the workshops. </p>

<p>Because students in this course have a wide range of experience, workshops are only <em>jumping off points for your personal investigations</em>. I will teach the necessary skills to complete each workshop, but if you already are familiar with the techniques to be covered, feel free to begin without me. </p>

<p>For this course we will be using the <a href="http://www.r-project.org/">R Project for Statistical Computing</a> for our workshops. No programming experience is necessary, and a gentle introduction to R will be covered in the course see <a href="test">R Resources</a> for more info on getting R set up on your laptop and learning the basics.  </p>

The infographic will be a simple one page document highlighting health disparities in the United States. It will serve as an introduction to both analysis and data visualization. You will use data from the Dartmouth Health Atlas (or a similar source, such as County Health Rankings) to construct their infographic. </p>

<p>2.A data driven journalism piece. 
The  journalism piece will use public access Medicare cost data and will consist of you guys writing an article similar in style to Elizabeth Rosenthalâ€™s great series of New York Times articles <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/06/health/even-small-medical-advances-can-mean-big-jumps-in-bills.html">a good example</a> and <a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/r/elisabeth_rosenthal/index.html">all of her work</a>. It is to be no more than 2 pages in length, and feature no more than two 2 visualizations. This will be assigned in the fifth week of the course <strong>10/6/14</strong> and is due two weeks later <strong>10/20/14</strong></p>
